# SPIRAL: A Ritual for Diasporic Grief and Radical Hope 🌀

**Project Status:** Active Prototyping (Collaboration: B21 McGill, Artch Festival)  
**Focus:** Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Bio-Sensing, Soft Robotics

## 1. The Vision
**SPIRAL** is a kinetic art installation that functions as a "living" entity. It approaches diaspora as a sensory condition—a complex layering of memory, sound, and touch. 

In my practice as a "baby researcher" and "baby artist," I treat academic theory as a material to be softened and shared. SPIRAL uses computer vision and bio-conductivity to "inhale" offerings and human presence, triggering a synchronized response of haptic feedback (heartbeat) and respiratory motion (breathing) to facilitate a speculative dialogue with the year 3333.

## 2. Research Context: Building 21 (McGill)
This project is the physical manifestation of my research at **Building 21**, where I investigate the **"Technology of Care."** As an M.Ed. student in Inclusive Education, I am exploring how to move beyond ocular-centric (sight-based) robotics to create more equitable and emotional interfaces.

* **Knowledge Translation:** Bridging the gap between academic theories of grief and lived sensory experience.
* **Non-Visual Literacy:** Prioritizing rhythm, heat, and haptics over visual displays to create an accessible ritual for all bodies.
* **The Pedagogy of the Spiral:** Developing a "loop" of multidirectional healing where we learn from our ancestors while simultaneously teaching our descendants.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 👁️ Perception (The Eye)
* **Hardware:** USB Webcam 
* **Software:** Python + OpenCV
* **Logic:** Computer vision identifies the placement of an artifact, transitioning the system from "Idle" to "Active Ritual" mode.

### 💧 Bio-Interface (The Connection)
* **Hardware:** Playtronica TouchMe (MIDI Interface) + Conductive Saline Pool
* **Logic:** A shallow water basin acts as a capacitive bridge. Participant interaction with the water modulates MIDI velocity, which Python maps to the frequency of the robotic 'heartbeat.'

### 🧠 Logic (The Brain)
* **Generative AI:** Google Gemini API (Visual-to-Text)
* **Translation:** A custom Python hub translates "3333 transmissions" into speculative narratives and hardware commands.

### 🫀 Actuation (The Body)
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno / ESP32
* **Haptics:** An array of vibration motors creating a rhythmic "pulse" for tactile interaction.
* **Kinetics:** A servo-actuated "lung" mechanism for biomorphic expansion and contraction.

## 4. Engineering Goals for Robotica Residency
As a researcher moving into hardware, my goals at Robotica are to:
1. **Water-Robotics Integration:** Engineering a safe, waterproof housing for sensors to allow human-to-water-to-robot interaction.
2. **Refine Biomorphic Motion:** Prototype a silent, durable servo-cam system for the breathing mechanism.
3. **Tactile Mapping:** Iterate on vibration patterns to ensure the 'heartbeat' is perceptible through different sculpture materials.
