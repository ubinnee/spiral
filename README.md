# SPIRAL: A Ritual for Diasporic Grief and Radical Hope 🌀

**Project Status:** Active Prototyping (Collaboration: B21 McGill, Artch Festival)  
**Focus:** Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Bio-Sensing, Affective Computing, Thermal Haptics

## 1. The Vision
**SPIRAL** is a kinetic art installation that functions as a "living" entity. It approaches diaspora as a sensory condition—a complex layering of memory, sound, and touch. 

As a "baby researcher" and "baby artist," I treat academic theory as a material to be softened and shared. SPIRAL uses computer vision, bio-conductivity, and voice recognition to "inhale" offerings and human presence. The altar responds with a synchronized sequence of biological warmth, rhythmic heartbeats, and respiratory motion to facilitate a speculative dialogue with the year 3333.

## 2. Research Context: Building 21 (McGill)
This project is the physical manifestation of my research at **Building 21**, where I investigate the **"Technology of Care."** As an M.Ed. student in Inclusive Education, I am exploring how to move beyond ocular-centric (sight-based) robotics to create more equitable and emotional interfaces.

* **Knowledge Translation:** Bridging the gap between academic theories of grief and lived sensory experience.
* **Non-Visual Literacy:** Designing for accessibility by prioritizing rhythm, heat, and haptics over visual displays.
* **The Pedagogy of the Spiral:** Developing a "loop" of multidirectional healing where we learn from our ancestors while simultaneously teaching our descendants.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 👁️ Perception (The Eye)
* **Hardware:** USB Webcam 
* **Software:** Python + OpenCV
* **Logic:** Identifies the placement of an artifact to wake the system from an idle state.

### 💧 Bio-Interface & Voice (The Connection)
* **Hardware:** Playtronica TouchMe + Dual Conductive Domes + Microphone
* **Logic:** A two-handed "embrace" of the altar's conductive spheres completes a capacitive circuit. This triggers the **Voice Recognition** module, allowing the ancestor to speak directly to the descendant.
* **Thermal Haptics:** Integrated heating elements (polyimide plates) provide biological warmth to the user's palms during the vocal offering.

### 🧠 Logic (The Brain)
* **Generative AI:** Google Gemini API (Multimodal: Vision + Speech-to-Text)
* **Translation:** A custom Python hub translates the visual offering and the ancestor's voice into a poetic "3333 transmission."

### 🫀 Actuation (The Body)
* **Haptics:** An array of vibration motors creating a rhythmic "pulse" and a "purr" during voice capture.
* **Kinetics:** A servo-actuated "lung" mechanism for biomorphic expansion and contraction.
* **Output:** Thermal printer delivering tangible, physical transcripts of the future.

## 4. Engineering Goals & Challenges
1. **Thermal Regulation:** Engineering a safe, thermistor-controlled heating system for the hand-interfaces.
2. **Fluid Conductivity:** Using saline water as a capacitive bridge for MIDI-mapped interaction.
3. **Biomorphic Mechanical Design:** Prototyping a silent cam-driven system for respiratory motion.
4. **Water-Electronics Safety:** Designing waterproof housings for the internal "nervous system."
